    <p> While Australians are surfing, Venezuelans are skating. It’s a long-running holiday tradition for the entire capital city of Caracas to roller skate
to early morning mass on Christmas Day. In fact, vehicles are banned from many parts of the city before 8 a.m. In case this form of transportation
isn’t strange enough, the night before kids will tie one end of a string to their big toe and hang the other end out of their bedroom window,
so passing roller skaters can give the string a friendly tug on their way to mass the next morning.</p>

    <p> In the United States, we associate Christmas with ham or figgy pudding, but in Japan, it’s all about Kentucky Fried Chicken.
An estimated 3.5 million Japanese families eat fried chicken on Christmas Eve thanks to a marketing stunt by KFC in the 1970s
called Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakkii (“Kentucky for Christmas”). Christians make up a very small percentage of the Japanese population,
so this campaign made up for a lack of Christmas holiday traditions. The KFC Christmas Meal is so popular, many customers pre-order
their dinners — which include fried chicken, cake and champagne — months in advance.</p>

    <p> Winter Solstice is an ancient tradition — possibly dating as far back as the Stone Age — that observes the shortest day of the year.
This occurs a few days before Christmas, and even though it’s celebrated in different forms everywhere from Sweden to Iran, England's
Stonehenge is thought to be one of the earliest epicenters for marking the longest night of the year due to the placement of the stones.
In fact, the Winter Solstice is still celebrated at Stonehenge, and anyone can buy tickets to experience the sunrise, along with Druid
and Pagan traditions.</p>
